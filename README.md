# Indata-Sudoku
The project aims at developing a C++ application program, that allows the user to solve a printed sudoku problem using time-efficient C++ algorithms.

## Input:
The input to the problem will be taken either from a .csv/.text file which contains the clues and position 
           value of the said problem in distinct formats.
## Output:
Solution for the printed sudoku.

## Future Scope:
Can use OpenCV-OCR(Optical Character recognization) libraries for realtime clue detection.
